# Welcome to TeamTracker

Team Tracker allows sports team managers to keep track of their players through a desktop management system and automatically sent out text messages. Managers can oversee all of their teams, players, and games through the web application, and are instantly notified of important events via text message. Using Twilio, future scheduled text messages are sent out automatically.
